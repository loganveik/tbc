### Description:
This is a website I manually built, purely by eyeballing the band's actual site. I built this to showcase my skills in mirroring either live websites or Photoshop mockups with 100% accuracy.

### Technologies Used:
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

### How to Use:
1) Home Page

2) Clicking on links opens a popup/modal page with info related to the link. Just like the actual website
